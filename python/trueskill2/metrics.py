"""Metric-driven evaluation — the §5 protocol.

"As each match was processed, we asked the model to predict the winning team
and give a probability for this event. When making this prediction, only the
team composition and squad membership are used ... Then we updated the skills
using the online updater with all of the information available at the end of
the match."

`evaluate_online` runs exactly that loop and returns per-player records so the
paper's subpopulation tables (win rate by squad size, experience, previous
kill rate, previous outcome — §§6-9) can be reproduced with `win_rate_by`.
