"""Match-result input types.

A match result, per the paper (§2), lists "the players involved, their team
assignments, the start time and length of the match, how long each player
played, and the final score of each team" — plus, for TrueSkill 2, each
player's squad size, kill/death counts and completion status.

Time is in MINUTES throughout (start_time is an absolute timestamp in minutes,
e.g. epoch-milliseconds / 60000).
